# Exoplantets_autoencoders
Exoplantets anommally detection with autoencoders with ~99% accuracy


## Data set
Code imports a csv from:  PHL-EC data set in github 
This repository contains the PHL-EC dataset used in the classification problem for exoplanets. The data set is used in the manuscript "Habitability Classification of Exoplanets: A Machine Learning Insight"
## Goal
The aim is to detect which planets are habitable versus the vast majority of planets that are not. 

## Structures 
To do so, 3 structures are presented:
1.- PCA + autoencoder. (99% accuracy) 
2.- deep autoencoder .(96% accuracy)
3.- autoencoder (dimension reduction) autoencoder (anomaly detection)
